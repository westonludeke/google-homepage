# google-homepage
testing github and building a Google homepage clone!
Project was originally made in November 2016 as part of [The Odin Project's section on Web Development and HTML/CSS basics](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This project has since been pushed [live on GitHub Pages](https://westonludeke.github.io/google-homepage/). You can view my Google.com homepage project that I developed in HTML and CSS back in Nov. 2016. Note that some of the links work and will work for you on your own Gmail account (as opposed to mine). The search bar is for display purposes only.
